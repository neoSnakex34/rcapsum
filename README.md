# rcapsum

### what it is it?
**r**aymond **c**arver lorem**ipsum** is an implmementation of a really basic markov chain based text generator.
It uses a gibberish text set based on a Raymon Carver novel (heavily edited to fit in fair use).
It accepts a min_len argument to select how many words one wants to generate.

usage:
```
ripsum
```
or: 
```
ripsum 50
```
I made it primarly to be used in helix editor with insert-output command.
It is intended to fill with sample text latex/typst documents or web pages.

It _should_ not contain any offensive english words, you can always change the input text to whatever you like.
