# rcapsum

### what it is it?
*r*aymond *ca*rver loremi*psum* is an implmementation of a really basic markov chains based text generator.
It uses a gibberish text set based on a Raymon Carver novel (heavily edited to fit in fair use).
It accepts a min_len argument to select how many words one wants to generate.

usage:
    rcapsum
or:
    rcapsum 50

I made it primarly to be used in helix editor with insert-output command.
It is intended to fill with sample text latex/typst documents or web pages.

It _should_ not contain any offensive english words, you can always change the input text to whatever you like.
